- This “process” of moving through the network is complex though, so we will divide it into five stages with at least one mathematical function each:
1.  Stage 1: **Forward Propagation**:
	- Required: [[Summation Operator]].
	- Required: [[Activation Function]].
2.  Stage 2: **Calculate the Total Error**:
	- Required: [[Cost Function]].
3.  Stage 3: **Calculate the Gradients**:
	- Required: Partial Derivative.
	- Required: Chain Rule.
4.  Stage 4: **Gradient Checking**:
	- Required: Gradient checking formula.
5.  Stage 5: **Updating Weights**:
	- Required: Weight update formula.
