- **Step 1**: Each input is multiplied by a Weight as it travels over an edge (connecting line) to a node in a following layer.
- **Step 2**: All inputs to a node, including the bias, are summed using the Summation Operator. The result is called the total Net Input.
- **Step 3**: The total Net Input is then fed into an Activation Function, which transforms the Net Input into a new output. This new output is then sent out over one or more edges andmultiplied by a Weight, and the cycle continues until the Output Layer calculations are completed.
