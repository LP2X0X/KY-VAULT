### Overview about Neural Network: 
- **Neural Networks Are Specific**: Neural Networks are always built to solve a specific type of problem. Examples of specific uses include: prediction, forecasting, estimation, classification, and pattern recognition.
- **Neural Networks Have Three Basic Parts**: A Neural Network has three basic sections, or parts, and each part is composed of “nodes”.
	1. **Input Layer**.
	2. **Hidden Layer(s)**.
	3. **Output Layer**.
- **Neural Networks Are Built Two Ways**:
	1. **Feedforward**: With a feedforward Neural Network, signals travel only one way, from input to output. These types of networks are used extensively in pattern recognition. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a specific type of feedforward network that is often used in image recognition.
	2. **Feedback** (or Recurrent Neural Networks, RNNs): With an RNN, signals can travel both directions and there can be loops.
- **Neural Networks Are Either Fixed or Adaptive**:
    1. **Fixed**: The weight values in a fixed network remain static. They do not change.
    2. **Adaptive**: The weight values in an adaptive network are not static and can change.
 - **Neural Networks Use Three Types of Datasets**: These three sets are usually taken from one very large dataset that represents the “gold standard” of data for a project, and are often split 60/20/20.
	1. **Training dataset**: The training dataset is used to adjust the weights of the neural network. (60%)
	2. **Validation dataset**: The validation dataset is used to minimize overfitting. (20%)
	3. **Testing dataset**: The testing dataset is used as a final test to gauge how accurately the network has been trained. (20%)
