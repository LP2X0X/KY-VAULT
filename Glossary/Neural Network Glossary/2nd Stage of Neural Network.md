- **Step 3**: The output of b2.
- **Step 4:** The output is multiplied by Weight w6.
- **Step 5**: The result is summed with all other inputs to create the Net Input of node c, netc.
- **Step 6**: Netc becomes the input of an Activation Function.
- **Step 7**: The Activation Functionâ€™s output is the final output of the network.
- **Step 8**: A Cost Function is applied to the output of the network, and a Total Error is calculated.
