- In stage 4, we covered Gradient Checking, which is a method that can be used to manually check a computed Gradient and make sure it is (more or less) accurate. Gradient Checking is optional, but many well-known researchers and scientists within the Machine Learning field advocate for it.
- We learned that Gradients are manually checked by creating two fictitious points on either side of a computed Gradient, and then calculating the slope of those points - which is rise over run. The result of this is the Numerical Estimation of the Gradient, which is then subtracted from the original computed Gradient, called the Analytical Gradient.
- The end result is the difference between the Estimated Gradient and the Computed Gradient, but this difference is often very small, such as 10-8. To make this number more useful, it is often converted to a Relative Error and then checked against a relative error guide, or table.
- If the Relative Error is small enough to be acceptable, the computed Gradient is considered valid and passes the test.
