- "Coplanarity‚Äù means the maximum distance that the physical contact points of a surface-mount device (SMD) can be from its seating plane or as a unilateral tolerance zone measured upward from the seating plane.

- When all the pin endpoints of the device are on the same plane, it has the closest contact with the PCB pad and better welding effect, but in fact, due to various factors such as manufacturing and transportation, all pin endpoints of the device are impossible to be on the same plane, and there will often be a certain coplanarity error (referred to as coplanarity).
- The standard tolerance value of pin coplanarity of surface mount devices formulated by the Joint Electronic Devices Engineering Committee (JEDEC) is 0.1mm, which means that each pin of the device must be within the tolerance zone of 0.1mm. This tolerance zone consists of two planes, one is the PCB land plane, and the other is the plane where the device pins are located.
