- API stands for Application Programming Interface, whichÂ is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.
- In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer.
- The interface to a software library is one type of API. The API describes and prescribes the "expected behavior" (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of this set of rules.
