 A raster graphic is an image that is stored as rectangle grid of pixels, and each pixel is assigned a color. Most graphic file formats that you are familiar with are just variations to this method. This includes formats such as GIF, JPEG, BMP, and PNG.
 Raster graphics are also called bitmaps. (Donâ€™t let the the BMP file format confuse you. The term bitmap is a general term describing a particular way to store image data.)
 Raster graphics are inefficient data-wise. Another problem with raster images is that they do not resize well.
