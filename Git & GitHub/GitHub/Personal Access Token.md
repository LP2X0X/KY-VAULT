1. Select “Settings”.
2. On the next screen, look for “Developer settings” in the left-hand menu. Click that.
3. On the next screen, click on “Personal access tokens.” This will lead you to a screen that lets you create a token that you can authenticate with GitHub using the terminal.
4. Click “Generate new token”.

5. GitHub will show you a final screen that reveals the token. Copy that access token and keep it somewhere secure—this gives you (or anyone else) access to your GitHub account. Treat it with care. If you lose the token you’ll have to do this whole exercise all over again.
