- YOLO is an abbreviation for the term 'You Only Look Once'. This is **an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time)**. Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.
- YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks ([[CNN]]) to detect objects in real-time. As the name suggests, the algorithm requires only a single forward propagation through a neural network to detect objects.
- This means that prediction in the entire image is done in a single algorithm run. The CNN is used to predict various class probabilities and bounding boxes simultaneously.
