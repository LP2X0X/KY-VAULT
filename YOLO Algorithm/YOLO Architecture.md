- **YOLO architecture** is FCNN ([[Fully Connected Neural Network]]) based.
- The YOLO framework has three main components:
	-   **Backbone**
	-   **Head**Â 
	-   **Neck**
- The **Backbone** mainly extracts essential features of an image and feeds them to the **Head** through **Neck**. The **Neck** collects feature maps extracted by the **Backbone** and creates feature pyramids. Finally, the head consists of output layers that have final detections.
