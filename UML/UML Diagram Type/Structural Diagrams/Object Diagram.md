# About
- Object is an instance of a class in a particular moment in runtime that can have its own state and data values.
- Object Diagram is an instance of a Class Diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time.
# Purpose of Object Diagram
-   During the analysis phase of a project, you might create a class diagram to describe the structure of a system and then create a set of object diagrams as test cases to verify the accuracy and completeness of the class diagram.
-   Before you create a class diagram, you might create an object diagram to discover facts about specific model elements and their links, or to illustrate specific examples of the classifiers that are required.
# Basic Object Diagram Symbols and Notations
## 1.Object Names
- Every object is actually symbolized like a rectangle, that offers the name from the object and its class underlined as well as divided with a colon.
