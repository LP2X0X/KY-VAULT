# About
- Interaction Overview Diagrams provide a high level of abstraction an interaction model.
- The Interaction Overview Diagram focuses on the overview of the flow of control of the interactions which can also show the flow of activity between diagrams.

| Interaction Use<br>Large and complex sequence diagrams could be simplified with interaction uses.<br> It is also common to reuse some interaction between several other interactions. | ![[04-interaction-overview-diagram-notation-interaction-use.png\|center]] |
