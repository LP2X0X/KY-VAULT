- Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a declarative XML-based language that Microsoft developed for initializing structured values and objects.
- XAML is the language used for creating user interfaces in WPF.
- You can create visible UI elements in the declarative XAML markup, and then separate the UI definition from the run-time logic by using code-behind files that are joined to the markup through partial class definitions.
