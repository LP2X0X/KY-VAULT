- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a free and open-source graphical subsystem (similar to WinForms) originally developed by Microsoft for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based applications.
- This runtime environment and SDK allows developers to create, and users to run, rich visual applications. WPF introduces XAML as the glue that binds everything together. XAML is a rich XML-based document format that allows for the declarative development of WPF applications using the WPF object model.
- WPF employs [[WPF/XAML/XAML]], an XML-based language, to define and link various interface elements. WPF applications can be deployed as standalone desktop programs or hosted as an embedded object in a website. WPF aims to unify a number of common user interface elements, such as 2D/3D rendering, fixed and adaptive documents, typography, vector graphics, runtime animation, and pre-rendered media. These elements can then be linked and manipulated based on various events, user interactions, and data bindings.
