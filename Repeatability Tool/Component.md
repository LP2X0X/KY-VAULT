PCBs are made up of a variety of different electrical components, each vital to the functionality of the device to which it will belong. These PCB components include transistors, fuses, resistors and capacitors,... which all play their part to ensure we have a smooth-running device â€“ if one of these components fails, the entire PCB will fail to work and thus affect the functionality of the product itself.
