Polarity describes the positive and negative pins so that they can be mounted in the right direction.
-   **Non-polarized component**: a part without polarity – can be connected in any direction and still function the way it’s supposed to function. A symmetric component rarely has more than two terminals, and every terminal on the components is equivalent. You can connect a non-polarized component in any direction, and it’ll function just the same.
-   **Polarized component**: a part with polarity – can only be connected to a circuit in one direction. A polarized component might have two, twenty, or even two-hundred pins, and each one has a unique function and/or position. If a polarized component was connected to a circuit incorrectly, at best it won’t work as intended. At worse, an incorrectly connected polarized component will smoke, spark, and be one very dead part.
