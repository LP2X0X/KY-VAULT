A PCB array is when a single PCB is replicated multiple times to make a larger array of connected boards or a “matrix” so to speak.
The reason a manufacturer would want their PCB in an array is to help them with the manufacturing assembly process. An array enables the ability to load the parts at a much faster rate because an entire array consisting of multiple PCBs can be loaded with components all at once instead of one at a time. The boards are loaded using automated equipment referred to as a [[SMT|“pick and place” machine]]. This equipment simply picks up parts (normally surface mount devices) and places the part down on the board.
