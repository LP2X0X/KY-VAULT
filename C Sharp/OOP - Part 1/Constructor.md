A Constructor is a special method that is used to ‘construct’ an object from the class template. 
It is the first method that is called whenever we create an object from our class. 
Constructors are commonly used to initialize the fields of the class.
A constructor always has the same name as the class (Staff in our case) and does not return any value.
```ad-note
We can have more than one constructor as long as the signature is different.
