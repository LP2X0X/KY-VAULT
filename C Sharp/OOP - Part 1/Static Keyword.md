static is a modifier in C# which is applicable for the following:Â 

    Classes
    Variables
    Methods
    Constructor
    Properties
    Event
    Operators

We can define class members as static using the static keyword. When we declare a member of a class as static, it means no matter how many objects of the class are created, **there is only one copy of the static member**.
Static variables are used for defining constants because their values can be retrieved by invoking the class without creating an instance of it.
```ad-note
A static class can only contain static members.
