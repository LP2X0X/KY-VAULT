- Sometimes in our program, it is necessary to convert from one data type to another, such as from a double to an int. This is known as Type Casting.
- To convert one numeric data type to another, we just need to add (new data type) in front of the data that we want to convert.
```csharp
int x = (int) 20.9;
float num1 = (float) 20.9;
decimal num2 = (decimal) 20.9;
```
