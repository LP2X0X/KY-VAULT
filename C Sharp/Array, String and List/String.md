# Notable Properties and Methods
- The *Substring()* **method** is used to extract a substring from a longer string. It requires two arguments. 
	- The first tells the compiler the index of the starting position to extract.
	- The second tells the compiler the length.
- We can use the *Equals()* **method** to compare if two strings are identical.
- The *Split()* **method** splits a string into substrings based on an array of user-defined separators. After splitting the string, the Split() method returns an **array** that contains the resulting substrings. (Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string.split?view=net-7.0)
