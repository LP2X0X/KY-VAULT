- Polymorphism refers to a program’s ability to use the correct method for an object based on its run-time type.
- Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects:
	- At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class in places such as method parameters and collections or arrays. When this polymorphism occurs, the object's declared type is no longer identical to its run-time type.
	- Base classes may define and implement *virtual* methods, and derived classes can override them, which means they provide their own definition and implementation. At run-time, when client code calls the method, the CLR looks up the run-time type of the object, and invokes that override of the virtual method. In your source code you can call a method on a base class, and cause a derived class's version of the method to be executed.
---
- The *virtual* keyword tells the compiler that this method may be overridden in derived classes. When the compiler encounters this keyword, it’ll look for the same method in the derived class and execute that method instead.
- Next, in the derived class, you have to declare that your method overrides the method in the parent class using the *override* keyword.
### Example
```csharp
public class Shape
{
    // A few example members
    public int X { get; private set; }
    public int Y { get; private set; }
    public int Height { get; set; }
    public int Width { get; set; }

    // Virtual method
    public virtual void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Performing base class drawing tasks");
    }
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // Code to draw a circle...
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle");
        base.Draw();
    }
}
public class Rectangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // Code to draw a rectangle...
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle");
        base.Draw();
    }
}
public class Triangle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        // Code to draw a triangle...
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a triangle");
        base.Draw();
    }
}
```
